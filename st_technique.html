        <h2>Process Mapping</h2>
        <li>  <a name="PrMa">  Process Mapping : Process mapping consists of three different kinds of charts: </a>
          Relationship Maps show the overall view. They show the departments of an organization and how they interact with
          suppliers and customers. </li>
          <li>  Cross-functional Maps or Swim Lane Charts show which department performs each step and the inputs and outputs of each step.
            These maps have more detail than a relationship map but less than a flowchart.
            <li>           Process Flow charts or Process Flow Diagrams take a single step from a cross-functional map and expand it
              to show more detail. Process flow charts and process flow diagrams are the same thing.
              Maps and flowcharts help people understand a work process. They make the tasks, interfaces, inputs,
              and outputs more visible. Analyzing a process map may help reduce cycle time, reduce costs, and increase productivity.

              <li>   These charts can be downloaded and edited. It is often easier to modify an existing chart than to draw a new one.

                  <li> Stanford’s Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design describes Design Thinking as a five-stage process.
                    These stages are not always sequential; nor do they require design teams to approach them thus. </li>

                    <li> Designers will find the stages often occur in parallel and see repeated use on an iterative basis.
                      Consequently, designers should consider these not a “recipe”,
                      but different modes that contribute to a project. </li>

                        Reference : https://www.greycampus.com/blog/quality-management/dmaic-a-six-sigma-process-improvement-methodology</a>

                        <li> How Six Sigma Works </li>


                        <li> There are three basic elements to Six Sigma: </li>

                        <li>    1. Process improvement: </li>


                        The purpose of process improvement is to remove the root causes of result deficiencies in processes that already exist in the organisation. These performance deficiencies may be causing real problems for the organisation, or may be preventing
                        it from working as efficiently and effectively as it could.
                        To reduce these defects a 5-step approach is used.

                        <li> 2. 2. Process design: Many a times simply improving existing processes is not enough, and, hence, new processes will need to be designed, or existing processes will need to be re-designed. There are several reasons why this could be necessary:

                          <p>       ● An organisation may choose to replace, rather than repair,
                            one or more of its core processes.
                          </p>
                          <p>       ● An organisation discovers, during an improvement project,
                            that simply improving an existing process will never deliver
                            the level of quality its customers are demanding.
                          </p>

                          <p>     ● An organisation identifies an opportunity to offer an entirely
                            new product or service.

                            As with process improvement, a five-step approach is used to design/re-design a process:
                          </p>


                          <li> 3. Process management: Because it requires a fundamental change in the way an organisation is structured and managed, process management is often the most challenging and time-consuming part of Six Sigma.

                            In general, process management consists of:
                          </p>
                          <p>      ● Defining processes, key customer requirements, and process “owners”.
                          </p>
                          <p>      ● Measuring performance against customer requirements and key performance indicators.
                          </p>
                          <p>      ● Analysing data to enhance measures and refine the process management mechanisms.
                          </p>
                          <p>      ● Controlling process performance by monitoring process inputs, process operation, and process outputs, and responding quickly to problems and process variations. </p>
